# My Journey to Programming

## Background

- Born and raised in PÃ¼ssi, Estonia
- Studied electronics at university
- First exposure to programming: Java, C++, bash scripting
- Initially found programming difficult
- Completed master's degree
- Worked as a medical engineer for 10 years
- Moved to Finland with family

## Motivation to Become a Programmer

- Wanted a career change after 35
- Started with learning JavaScript in spare time
- Discovered Hive Helsinki (School 42 affiliate)
- Main motivation: ability to work remotely
- Other expectations:
  - Working from tropical locations
  - Being part of a large community
  - Career growth opportunities
  - Higher salary

## Bootcamp Experience

- Took 4 weeks off work for the selection process
- Learned C programming fundamentals
- Gained console skills
- Was accepted and became a full-time student
- Quit previous job to focus on studies

## Education at Hive

- Challenging to study after 35 with family and two children
- Completed the program in 1 year and 3 months
- Project-based learning with gamification elements
- Peer review system for projects
- Four specialization paths: web, graphics, algorithms, computer programs
- Chose algorithms path (regretted not choosing web or graphics)
- Found coding immersive - entered "flow state" often

## Job Search

- First attempts were unsuccessful
- Started applying after 6 months of study
- Got some interviews but failed technical assignments
- Lacked practical knowledge in commercial technologies
- First job came after one year of study
- Hired at Tietoevry (largest outsourcing firm in Finland) as junior developer
- Project was canceled, but gained valuable experience in C# and Azure

## Current Work and Good Engineering Practices

- Now works at a company with solid engineering practices:
  - Multiple environments (development, test, production)
  - Automated tests
  - QA assistance
  - Self-written tests for each feature
  - GitLab workflow with code reviews
  - Design documentation for features
  - Daily team meetings
  - Bi-weekly project demos
- Recent project: dynamic form rendering (took 2 months)

## Advice for Aspiring Programmers

- Practice code reviews and effective communication
- Learn thorough testing
- Master Git
- Design before coding: sketch, pseudocode
- Communicate with colleagues
- Show independence in problem-solving but ask questions
- Look for team leads who were former engineers/QA
- Be cautious of managers who don't understand the product

## Conclusions

- Has been working as a programmer for 2.5 years
- Enjoys seeing results of his work
- Appreciates the problem-solving aspects
- Works on side projects (Telegram job search bot, AI media content chat)
- Constantly learning new technologies
- Reality check:
